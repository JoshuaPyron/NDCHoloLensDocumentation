## Gestures
**_Gaze_** - This is the direction where your head is facing, represented by a cursor.\
**_Tap_** - This gesture is used to click on objects. This is done by holding up one finger, with your thumb resting across you other fingers, then tapping you thumb with your extended finger.\
**_Pinch_** - This is used to drag objects. This is done by making an L with you thumb and forefinger, then pressing the two together. You can then drag an object to the desired location and release it by separating your thumb and forefinger.\
**_Bloom_** - This opens the Main menu for the HoloLens. With you palm up and fingers straight, bring all of your fingers together, then spread out your fingers until parallel with your palm.

For practice (and better explanations), open the "Learn Gestures" app on your HoloLens.

Remember to be very deliberate with your actions.

## Menus
### Selection Menu
This is the menu where you select the product you wish to work with and is divided into 3 sub-menus: Favorites, Categories, and AZ.
##### Favorites Menu
This is the menu that the application will boot to. The menu contains every product the is inside of the application in alphabetical order. We intended to have a system that determines which products you have looked at recently or scan your network for any devices you have and place them first; however, that was never implemented.
##### Category Menu
This menu contains all of the products in the application sorted by the category they are in. Each Product division of the company has a category (CMT, Food Bulk, etc.); however, the products we have in CMT or Food Bulk Packaging.
##### AZ Menu
This menu contains all of the products in the application sorted by the first letter of their name. For example, if A is selected, the Accuscan 6050, AS5012, and AS4012 are displayed.
### Demo Menu
Once a product has been selected and the "Demo" button pressed, this menu will pop up.
In this menu, you can display a product, display various attachments, and play a short animation.
### Service Menu
In this Menu, you can choose a part to service, step through servicing any part, and toggle visibility on certain parts.

## Moving the UI
In the upper right hand corner of the menu, there should be a small box with a double sided arrow in the center. If clicked, the resizer box will turn on. The corners (cubes) are used to scale, the spheres are used to rotate, and dragging anywhere else in the box will move the UI.\

Now, any action you make will be sent to the other HoloLenses in the session.

## Manuals
At any time, you can pull up a manual for the product you are looking at. To do this, click on the manuals Button in the Quick Actions Menu and select the manual you want. The manuals will popup in a menu with the resizer activated. Position the menu where you would like and tap to place. You can move these at any time using the menu's [resizer](#moving-the-ui)\
